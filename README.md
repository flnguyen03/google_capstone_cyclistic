## Preface:
I'll be presenting my data analysis to a big audience. Several people present are, **Lily Moreno:** the director of marketing and my manager over at a fictious company named, Cyclistic including the marketing analystics team and the executive team. For detail context of the capstone case study including steps of the data preparations, please follow this [link](https://github.com/flnguyen03/google_capstone_cyclistic).

*Background:* "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?". 

We will take a look at a Power BI dashboard I develop using Calendar Year 2021 data. I choose to isolate my analysis to Calendar Year 2021 to observe a one-year trend initial as the Calendar Year 2022 hasn't completed yet. Next month I will present a two-year historical trend of Calendar Year 2021 and 2022.
